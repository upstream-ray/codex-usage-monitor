# Troubleshooting Codex Usage

## Taskbar error labels

Codex Usage keeps authentication failures separate from transient service failures:

| Simplified Chinese | Other languages | Meaning | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `!` | `!` | Credentials are missing or expired | Sign in with the relevant CLI/app, then refresh Codex Usage |
| `网络` | `NET` | Network or TLS connection failed | Check connectivity, VPN, proxy, and firewall settings |
| `限流` | `429` | Provider rate limit | Wait for the provider retry window; Codex Usage retries with backoff |
| `服务` | `5XX` | Provider service failure | Wait and retry; check provider status if it persists |
| `错误` | `ERR` | Invalid or unsupported response | Enable diagnostics and inspect the log |

Authentication failures pause provider polling until the credential source changes, preventing repeated login notifications. Transient failures use exponential backoff up to the configured refresh interval.

## Diagnostic log

Run:

```powershell
codex-usage.exe --diagnose
```

The log is written to `%TEMP%\codex-usage.log`. It includes:

- application version and executable path
- direct or WinGet install channel
- provider failure category and retry delay
- window creation, taskbar placement, and relaunch events

The log does not include access tokens, refresh tokens, credential file contents, or API response bodies.

## Update failures

Direct installations and portable copies download only the exact `codex-usage.exe` asset and verify it against `codex-usage.exe.sha256` from the same GitHub Release. The updater keeps the previous EXE until the downloaded version has been installed and restarted successfully. If restart fails, the old EXE is restored.

WinGet-managed installations delegate upgrades to WinGet:

```powershell
winget upgrade --id Ray.CodexUsage --exact
```

## Reset local position without deleting settings

Right-click the taskbar component and choose **Settings > Reset Position**. Settings are stored at `%APPDATA%\CodexUsage\settings.json`.

## Reinstall while preserving settings

Normal uninstall keeps the settings file. Reinstalling restores the saved language, refresh interval, provider selection, widget visibility, and taskbar position. Use `uninstall.ps1 -RemoveSettings` only when a full reset is intended.
